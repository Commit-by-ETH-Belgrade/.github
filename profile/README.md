# Commit

Commit is na event platform, like [Luma](https://lu.ma/home) but with staking as an application mechanism for events. If you show up at the event, your stake is returned. No show up, no stake back. No more 1400 applications and 10 attendees. <b>Slashed stakes are redirected to funding public goods :)</b>
